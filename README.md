# DIY_PIXELSTICK_Arduino_Nano
This is my take on the DIY PIXEL Stick but attempting to use it with an Arduino Nano and OLED. At present it does not fit on the Nano as it is about 14% over memory. I guess we should be calling this "My brazen attempt at using a Nano for a Mega task."

The original inspiration comes from Michael Ross at http://mrossphoto.com/digital-light-wand/ and;
Spicy Turtles instructable found here https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Pixel-Stick/

This is my first project using Arduino and I have had some guidance from close friends. Most noteable mention goes to Preecington https://github.com/Preecington for his disturbingly large amount of knowledge of all things related to C.

My project consists of the following;
- Arduino Nano v3
- 144 LED RGBW strip
- AD Keypad 5 keys
- Micro SD reader
- 128x64 .96" I2C OLED Yellow/Blue Monochrome (no reason for the yellow blue was just what came up and cheapest)
- On/Off Switch
- 2.4A 5V 6600mAH portable phone charger.

I will continue to add more materials as I go such as the rigid materials to hold all the bits together but for now its a test bench item.

**INFORMATION**
SD Card has to be able to be formatted in FAT. I just changed SD card to a 2GB one and it now loads in a loop from ADFRUIT Logo to Scanning files
