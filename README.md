# DIY_PIXELSTICK_Arduino_Nano
This is my take on the DIY PIXEL Stick but attempting to use it with an Arduino Nano and OLED. 

The original inspiration comes from Michael Ross at http://mrossphoto.com/digital-light-wand/ and;
Spicy Turtles instructable found here https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Pixel-Stick/

This is my first project using Arduino and I have had some guidance from close friends. Most noteable mention goes to Preecington https://github.com/Preecington for his disturbingly large amount of knowledge of all things related to C.

My project consists of the following;
- Arduino Nano v3
- 144 LED RGBW strip
- AD Keypad 5 keys
- Micro SD reader
- 128x64 .96" I2C OLED Yellow/Blue Monochrome (no reason for the yellow blue was just what came up and cheapest)
- On/Off Switch
- 2.4A 5V 6600mAH portable phone charger.

I will continue to add more materials as I go such as the rigid materials to hold all the bits together but for now its a test bench item.
